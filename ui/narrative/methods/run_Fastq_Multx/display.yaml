parameters :
	index_mode :
		ui-name : |
			Barcode Mode
		short-hint : |

	index_info :
		ui-name : |
			Manual Barcode Map (if not Auto-detect nor Index lane library)
		short-hint : |
			The Read Group to Barcode Mapping. If there are two barcodes, hyphenate them, space delimited.
	input_reads_ref :
		ui-name : |
			Input Read Library
		short-hint : |
			The read library to examine.
	input_index_ref :
		ui-name : |
			Index Lane Library (optional)
		short-hint : |
			The index read library with the barcodes (split from the rest of the read).
	desc :
		ui-name : |
			Output ReadsSet Description
		short-hint : |
			Describe the demultiplexed set of read libraries.
	output_reads_name :
		ui-name : |
			Output ReadsSet
		short-hint : |
			The base name for the output read library or read library set object.
	use_header_barcode :
		ui-name : |
			Find barcode in each fastq record header
		short-hint : |
			Use barcode in the header instead of sequence row.
	force_beg :
		ui-name : |
			Require 5' start for barcode
		short-hint : |
			Require that there are no bases before the barcode at the beginning.
	force_end :
		ui-name : |
			Require 3' end for barcode
		short-hint : |
			Require that there are no bases after the barcode at the end.
	trim_barcode :
		ui-name : |
			Trim barcode from output reads
		short-hint : |
			Remove barcode from the output sequence.
	suggest_barcodes :
		ui-name : |
			Just suggest barcodes (but don't demultiplex)
		short-hint : |
			Don't actually run demultiplex, just detect barcodes.
	mismatch_max :
		ui-name : |
			Barcode Mismatch Max
		short-hint : |
			The maximum mismatches to accept in a barcode.
	edit_dist_min :
		ui-name : |
			Edit Distance Min.
		short-hint : |
			The minimum sequence distance between barcodes.
	barcode_base_qual_score_min :
		ui-name : |
			Qual Score Min.

			Barcode Options
		short-hint : |
			Where to find and what to do with the barcode.
	force_edge_options :
		ui-name : |
			Require Terminal Barcode
		short-hint : |
			Whether the barcode must be at the 5' or 3' of the read.
	dist_and_qual_params :
		ui-name : |
			Match Parameters

   <p>Deprecation Announcement:</p>
   <p>This App is being deprecated due to a high fail rate: meeting the criteria for deactivation.</p>
   <p>Demultiplex with ea-utils FASTQ-MULTX is in the process of being refactored and improved by the Kbase Team. If this app is needed for your work or analyses in KBase please contact our team.</p>
   <p>This App demultiplexes a reads library into a ReadsSet using the FASTQ-MULTX program in the EA Utils package. It is capable of automatically determining barcode IDs, and can verify that multiple reads are kept in-sync during demultiplexing.</p>
   <p><strong>Team members who developed & deployed algorithm in KBase:</strong> Dylan Chivian.</p>
